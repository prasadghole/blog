Well time has come to install vim plugins for using more advance features
of vim. There are lots many options available but I choose `vim plug` 
being simple and easy to use.

## Installation
[Github repo](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) has all necessary 
details for installing so I won't repeat here.

## Plugins I use
### fzf
Fuzzy finder

### vim surround

### vim multiple cursor

### vim git gutter

### vim airline

### vim nerdcommenter

### emmet

### vim slumlord

### cvim
