# Vim vs EMACS
I thought this war was over for me. But recently I gave one more try to emacs. Org mode
is single most reason for this shift. 

In EMACS I can
- Document in mLrkdown
- Use agenda for task management
- Time tracking and reporting
- Text based web browsing (including picture)
- Extending using LISP 
- Better GUI with multiple fonts and glyphs
- More than text editor.

But neovim with its multithreading, non-blocking mode give more edge to already faster
vim.

| Parameters    | VIM    | EMACS |
| ------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Speed         | Fast   | Slow  |
| Multithread   | Yes    | No    |
| Org mode      | No     | Yes   |
| Time Tracking | No     | Yes   |
| Web browsing  | No     | Yes   |

My current 2022 choice is use EMACS for documentation and literate programming using bable.
And for software development use nvim.
