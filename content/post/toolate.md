We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with 
fierce  urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of like aand history there
is a such thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time.
Life often leaves us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity.
The tide in the affairs of men does not remain at the flood; it ebbs. We may 
cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is deaf to every
plea and rush on. Over the bleached bones and jumbuled residue of numerous 
civilizations are written the pathetic word  **Too Late**

***Martin Luther King Jr.***

***Beyond Vietnam - a time to break silence***
