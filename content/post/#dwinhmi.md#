# Setup

![setup](/images/post/dwinsetup.jpeg)
I bought DWIN COF 4.3 inch display from [robu](https://robu.in/product/dwin-tn-resistive-touch-4-3-inch-cof-display/) along with [HDL66A](https://robu.in/product/debugging-hdl662s-adapter-board/) adapter board. These 2 connected to PC USB port with male to male USB cable.

Default HMI interface is in chinease and I want to use my own UI.

# Development Tools

# Demo project
I downloaded [Demo GUI](https://www.electroniclinic.com/dmg80480c043_02wtc-touch-screen-getting-started-tutorial/)

Using tutorial when I tried to download project as is, it was not successful. But then I made sure resolution
is changed to matching with my COF display (480 * 272) I was able download files and see change in factory 
programmed UI.

Next task is to download through SD card.

# Hello world
After downloading above project. I tried my own hands on hello world program after following 
many youtube videos and tutorials but not able to run on target HMI. Program was simulating
properly on DGUS software, but when downloaded on HMI shows static screens which were not
part of hello world program.

To fix this I downloaded [factory demo](https://www.dwin-global.com/factory-demo/) for my model
DMG48270F043_01WTR board.

I observed DWIN_SET files in factory demo do not include *32.icl* as mentioned in other projects 
but infact contain 24.icl. Hence after chaning output file name to 24.icl and making changes
in configuation. I was able to download and run my Hello world program successfully.

[Hello World](https://github.com/prasadghole/dwin/tree/main/DGM48270F043_01WTR/HelloWorld) is 
availble in github for referance.


# Formatting SD card
SD card size limitations as per documentation in 1 to 16 GB. For my system
card was on D drive hence I issued folloing command

```
FORMAT d:/fs:fat32/a:4096 
```

This took almost 10 minutes or more to format 16 GB of card.

After copying it to SD card, and restarting still no blue boot screen. 
But previous UI also do not start.

Till I figure out this I will continue explore using USB download.

# DWIN display memory layout

## Flash
16 MB of flash is divided into 64 sectors of each 256 KB. 
Each sector index 0 to 63 will have file names accordingly.

![Flash Space](/images/post/dwin_flashspace.PNG)

## RAM
128 KB flash is aligned as 2 bytes continuous memory.
Address 0x0000 to 0x0FFF is reserved for system variable.

# UI development

## Interface objects
If we assume model view controller (MVC) architecture we can consider
interface objects as model.

### Variable Pointers (VP)
DGUS uses simple memory map address similar to MODBUS protocol to issue
read/write commands and read/write data. GUI objects called as interface
objects values are stored in memory addresses called as Variable Pointers
(VP). VP values are modified only by user interaction.

### Description Pointers (SP)
A description pointer is a VP whose value can be modified by user using
communication interface.

Its UI developers responsibility to make sure VP length should be such that 
there addresses are not overlapped.

## Controls
These are view of MVC architecture. Control have minimum 5 properties/parameters
