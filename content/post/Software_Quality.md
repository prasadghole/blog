# Zen of Python
  - Beautiful is better than ugly.
  - Explicit is better than ugly.
  - Simple is better than complex.
  - Complex is better than complecated.
  - Flat is better than nested.
  - Sparse is better than dense.
  - Readability counts.
  - Special cases are's special enough to break the rules.
  - Although practicality beats beats purity.
  - Errors should never pass silently.
  - Unless explicitly silenced.
  - In face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation of guess.
  - There should be one and preferably only obvious way to do it.
  - Now is better than never.
  - Although never is often better than right now.
  - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  - If the implementation is easy to explain,it may be good idea.

Even though this is zen of python it applies to any programming practice irrespective
of language.
