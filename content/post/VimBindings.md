Even though you know vim is my first choice as editor in some situation we can't use vim as standalone application. But not to worry vim keybindings are now available In this post I am listing all the
vim bindings I am using.

### Vrapper for Eclipse

### Vim for Visual Studio code

### FakeVim for QT Creator
### Evil for emacs
### Online code editors
