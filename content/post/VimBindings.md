Even though you know vim is my first choice as editor in some situation we can't use vim as standalone application. But not to worry vim keybindings are now available In this post I am listing all the
vim bindings I am using.

# VIM for bash 
{{<highlight C "hl_lines=1 " >}}

set -o vi

{{</ highlight >}}
# Vrapper for Eclipse

# Vim for Visual Studio code

# FakeVim for QT Creator
# Vim for browser
Why use vim for text editing only with firefox and chrome extension I use vim for
browsing using only keyboard.
